  "desc1":"Rainbow trout get their name from the beautiful colors that shine on their skin.
  Coloration of the rainbow trout varies widely in relation to sex, habitat, and maturity.
  Colors on the back of a trout can range from brown, to olive, to dark blue.
   All rainbow trout have a pinkish band running the length of their body, and a silver underside that fades to pearl white.
   There are small black spots on their back, fins, and tail.",

  "desc2":"A distinct characteristic of the rainbow trout is an innate desire to return to spawn in the same stream as they were hatched.
   During spawning season in the spring, a rainbow trout will find a secluded cove or inlet.
   A female will dig a depression in the gravel called a 'redd' where she will lay her eggs.
   After a male fertilizes them, the female will bury the eggs in the redd for protection during incubation, and then leaves the nest.
    If the temperature of the water is cool enough, the eggs will hatch about 21 days after they are laid.
    Only a few of the 200 to 8,000 eggs that were spawned will live to be adults.
     The average lifespan for a rainbow trout is 4 to 6 years in the wild.",
