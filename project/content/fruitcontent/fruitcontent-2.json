    "desc1": "Did you know that some scientists believe that bananas can cure stomach ulcers? According to Dr David Lewis of the Pharmacy Department at Britain's Aston University, bananas contain an active ingredient claimed to be safer, gentler and more effective than most drugs. But Dr. Lewis said that the bananas should be unripe and uncooked. Cooking destroys curative properties. Now, if you don't have ulcers and don't like unripe bananas, do not dismiss bananas altogether. They are nutritious too. Why not take those that are delicious when ripe? Bananas are a good source of Vitamin A. The pisang emas for example, contains as much as 70 mcg(micrograms) of the vitamin per 100 g. Most common varieties give about 50 mcg per 100 g.",

    "desc2": "There are many varieties of bananas from which you can pick your choice. Some popular varieties are pisang emas, pisang rastali, pisang embun. They may vary in size, shape and taste, but in terms in nutrients, they are basically the same. So, if ever you cannot decide what fruit to buy for dessert, remember the banana.",
