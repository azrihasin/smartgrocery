    "desc1": "For many Malaysians, just the mention of this fruit makes the mouth water. That's not suprising because the pineapple is one of the most delicious fruits around, with a sweetish tangy taste that lingers on hours after you have eaten it. There are many ways to eat the pineapple and whichever it is, it always tastes good. You can get it fresh, add it to your rojak or cook it in your curry and laksa.",

    "desc2": "You can make your own pineapple juice which is most refreshing on a hot day. And don't think that's all the pineapple has to offer. Taste apart, the fruit is very nutritious too. It is an excellent source of Vitamin A, containing almost 7 times the amount found in the imported apple. It also contains ample amounts of the B-Vitamins and Vitamin C. The pineapple is also a good source of minerals like calcium and iron.",
