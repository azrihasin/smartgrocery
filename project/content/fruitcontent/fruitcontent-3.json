    "desc1": "Talk about Vitamin C and you will probably think of the imported orange. That's not suprising because we have heard a lot about the orange where Vitamin C is concerned. We all know that Vitamin C is good for us. It gives us a clear complexion and helps our bodies resist infections. And many of us go for oranges because we think that they are the best source of Vitamin C we can find. How many people actually give a second thought to our local fruits? The jambu batu or guava, for instance? Did you know that this humble fruit is a mine of Vitamin C, out-classing even the imported orange?",

    "desc2": "It contains almost 4 times the Vitamins C present in the orange and about 5 times that of another Vitamin C rich fruit, the lemon! A 100 g portion of the fruit gives 152 mg Vitamin C compared to the same portion of orange which gives 39.6 mg and the lemon, 362.6 mg. It also contains ample amounts of other vitamin like Vitamin A and the B-vitamins. Each 100 g guava gives 10 mcg Vitamin A.",
