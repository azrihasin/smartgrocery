Apples are high in fiber, vitamin C and various antioxidants. They are also very filling, considering their low calorie content. Studies show that eating apples can have multiple benefits for health .

They taste delicious on their own and are usually eaten raw, but they are also used in various recipes, juices and drinks.

  "desc2":"The original wild ancestor of Malus pumila was Malus sieversii,
  found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
  Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species,
  most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed o
  ver a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species
  into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted
   in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically
    similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates",
