  "desc1":"An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.
  The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.
  Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by
  European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse,
  Greek and European Christian traditions.Apple trees are large if grown from seed. Generally, apple cultivars
  are propagated by grafting onto rootstocks, which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than
   7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. y",

  "desc2":"The original wild ancestor of Malus pumila was Malus sieversii,
  found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
  Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species,
  most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed o
  ver a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species
  into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted
   in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically
    similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates",
