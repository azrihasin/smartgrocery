    "desc1": "What fruits are red and hairy on the outside but pearly white or yellow inside? You have guessed it., it's none other than rambutan. Its name is in fact derived from the Malay word rambut foe hair. The rambutan is a very popular fruit here. Even foreigners who have tried the fruit want to take it again. And no wonder, since the fruit is absolutely delicious. The translucent flesh is firm and juicy with a sweet pleasant flavour.",

    "desc2": "However, not many people know about its nutritive value. In terms of minerals, it has an adequate amount of calcium, phosphorus and iron though the calcium content may not be as high as that of the orange. Calcium phosphate is the material that gives hardness and strength to bones and teeth. Besides these, the rambutan also has some fibre and a little protein too. Thus, we can see that the fruit is not only delicious, it is quite nutritive too.",
