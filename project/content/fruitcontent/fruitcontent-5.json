    "desc1": "Mango-the mere mention of this fruit will make many mouths water. This is hardly suprising for the mango is sweet and juicy. It is no wonder this fruit is very popular among many Malaysians. Also known as the 'tropical apple', the mango comes in many different varieties. However, locally available mangoes which are mainly yellow in colour and flushed with red, are imported from Thailand, Burma and India. The most popular variety is the Indian mango.",

    "desc2": "But no matter what its shape or variety is, the mango has its fair share of nutrients, just like other fruits. Although the nutrient contents may differ according to the variety, mangoes are generally an excellent source of Vitamin C and calcium. A 100 g portion of this fruit will provide you with as much as 20.5 mg of Vitamin C which is good for the complexion and helps our body to resist infections. This is about 3 times as much as the amounts found in grape.",
