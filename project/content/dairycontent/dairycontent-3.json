  "desc1":"Cottage cheese, also known as curds and whey, is a fresh cheese curd product with a mild flavor. It does not have any added color and is not aged. It is made not by pressing the cheese but by draining it, which allows some of the whey to stay which keeps the curds loose.Cottage cheese is low in food energy compared to some other types of cheese. As a result, it is popular among dieters and some health devotees. It can be used in a wide variety of foods such as yogurt, fruit, toast, granola, in salads, as a dip, and as a replacement for mayonnaise. Cottage cheese dates back to the ancient Mesopotamia 3100â€“510 BC, where it was first found accidentally made in a sheep's stomach bag. It was later made in cottages using leftover milk. During World War 1, it was widely promoted in the United States, in order to save meat for infantry rations.",
