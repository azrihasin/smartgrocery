  "desc1": "You have probably eaten kangkung, easily available in the market. Thought to originate in India, the water convolvulus is now found throughout Southeast Asia. This vegetable is extremely rich in vitamins and minerals required for the various functions of the body. One is Vitamin A, essential for good eyesight. You can easily get 0.8 milligrams of this vitamin from 100-gram portion of kangkung - almost enough for your body's daily requirement. What's more, the vegetable has also a high Vitamin C content. A 100-gram serving is nearly enough for your body's need in a day. Also this is more than the amount found in orange, commonly taken for its Vitamin C.",

  "desc2": "As for minerals, kangkung boasts of an ample amount of calcium: with 3 1/2 times more than the amount found in cauliflower. Large amounts of potassium and sodium are also found in kangkung. The vegetable also has medicinal uses. In Chinese medicine it is used as a tonic, a laxative and even as an antidote in certain cases of food poisoning. In Indonesia it is used for insomnia and headaches.",
