  "desc1": "The red juicy tomato is a vegetable but you are not alone if you have mistaken it for a fruit. It was even called 'loved apple' once. This native of South America grows wild on the slopes of the Andes - hence its name which is derived from the Mexican Indian word tomatl. Soon after the Spaniards' conquest of Mexico, the fruit was taken to Europe after 1532. In Italy it caught on so to become part of the national diet.",
