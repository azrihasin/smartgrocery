  "desc1": "Rabbits have known for centuries that carrots do you good. Eating them raw gives you the calcium, Vitanins A and C and fibre, while the cruch tones and strengthens your gums. They make good snacks, far more nutritious and less lethal than chocolates and sweets. Choose those not longer than 6 inches and hard-the smaller the better and sweeter. The carrot has been aroundnsince ancient times, originating from the Mediterranean, a favourite with Romans. Eventually it was brought to China around 13th century from West Asia to India from Persia.",

  "desc2": "When eating carrots, never peel the vegetable as the outer part is the richest in nutrients, just scrape them. Cut them lengthwise and not too small - small rounds lose half their protein and vtamins in the water. Cook them in soups ans stews so that the nutrients that go into the liquid are not thrown away. Because they are so rich in nutrients, many swear by raw carrots juice as a protection against anaemia, liver and bowel disorders, and skin diseases. It helps to lessen vitiligo, the formation of white patches on the body due to loss of the natural pigment. Carrots provide relief from constipation and soothes a stomach ulcer. Boil a kilo of carrots for 2 hours in a litre of water. Blend in a liquidiser or rub through a sieve. The soup is then taken.",
