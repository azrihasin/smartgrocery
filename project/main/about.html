      <h3>About Smart! Grocery</h3>

      <p>One fine morning, one of us headed to the refrigerator in the kitchen. His eyes then opened wide. There was nothing in it.
         "It couldn't be!" He said. He tried to call for his mother, but no answer was heard. As he closed the refrigerator door, he found two pieces of paper
         on it. One of it read, "Admin, please buy these at the supermarket. Love, Mom." The other one was the groceries list.
         He had no choice but to head to the supermarket to restock it.
         As he arrived at the supermarket, he took the list out of his pocket, written by his mother.
         There was one problem, though. He could not identify a single thing on the list. There he stood, for 10 minutes, struggling to
         mutter the words, looking around him. Everything seemed so foreign to him, all vegetables looked the same.
         Alas, he gave up and returned home, and could only count moments as his mother returned home, to wreak havoc upon his poor soul after discovering
         that the refrigerator stayed hollow as his will to survive that event.</p>

      <p><strong>Thanks to that particular... story, this website was born. He came up with the idea of helping other people to recognize what to choose and buy,
        so others won't feel the pain that he had to endure. Our team was formed not long after, and here we are, working hard to add as many items as we can
        to the inventory.</strong></p>
